DOAB Check is a collaboration between the Free Ebook Foundation and the Directory of Open Access Books. It checks each the links in DOAB about once a month, looking for any links that are broken or misconfigured.
</p>
<p>
We've grouped the links by the hostname for the links url to make it easier for publishers to see whether links they've entered into the DOAB database are working as suspected. 
</p>
<p>
When a link is checked we record the status code returned by the web server. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>"403" indicates a misconfigured server that is not allowing access to the promised resource. 
<li>"404" means the link is broken - the resource is not found.
<li>"500" means something has gone wrong.
<li>"503" means that a website couldnâ€™t be reached. This could happen because the server was too busy, under maintenance, or something else.
<li>"504" indicates that the server, while acting as a gateway or proxy did not get a response in time from an upstream server. 
<li>"511" indicates a problem with the security of the connection - most often an incomplete certificate.
<li>"None" or "0" means something has gone terribly wrong.
</ul>

We have a few ways to view the results.
<ul>
<li>
View <a href="{% url 'problems' %}">the links which appear to have problems</a>.
</li>
<li>
View <a href="{% url 'providers' %}">the list of host names we've checked</a>.
</li>
<li>
View <a href="{% url 'publishers' %}">the list of publishers whose links we've checked</a>.
</li>
</ul>
