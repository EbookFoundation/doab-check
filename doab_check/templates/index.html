DOAB Check is a collaboration between the Free Ebook Foundation and the Directory of Open Access Books. It checks all the links in DOAB, looking for any links that are broken or misconfigured.
</p>
<p>
We've grouped the links by the hostname for the links url to make it easier for publishers to see whether links they've entered into the DOAB database are working as suspected. 
</p>
<p>
When a link is checked we record the status code returned by the web server. "404" means to link is broken. "403" indicates a misconfigured server that is not allowing access to the promised resource. "500" means something has gone wrong. "None" means something has gone terribly wrong.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
View <a href="{% url 'providers' %}">the list of host names we've checked</a>.
</li>
</ul>
We'll be adding more views of the link checking data as the project develops.
